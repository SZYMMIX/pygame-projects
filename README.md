# 🎮 Pygame Projects

Welcome! This repository is a collection of games I've created using Python and the Pygame library.

## 🕹️ The Games

### 🚀 Space Shooter
A classic top-down arcade shooter. Your mission is to pilot a spaceship, dodge enemy fire, and destroy as many meteors as you can to achieve a high score.

**How to Run:**
1. Navigate to the game's directory: `cd "Space Shooter"`
2. Run the main script: `python main.py` (or `python3 main.py`)

## 🛠️ Requirements

To run these games, you will need Python and the Pygame library installed.

You can install Pygame using pip:
```bash
pip install pygame
